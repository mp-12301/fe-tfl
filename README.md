# fe-tfl
Front end sample that displays TFL information.

## Note
I did not managed to complete the whole exercise under 4 hours, so I was only able to finish the structure of the project and address the first requirement, more or less was about to finish the second, third one is fully missing. 

## Installation

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mpereira96/fe-tfl.git project
cd project
cp .env-example .env
npm install
```

## Usage

```
npm start                   # start server (by default at http://localhost:8080)
npm run start:dashboard     # start server using webpack-dashboard
npm run build               # production build (remember to build with NODE_ENV=production)
